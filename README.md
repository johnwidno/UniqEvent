Intro and Brainstorming App Idea

## Uniq Event : App that can help students or anybody that are in the uniq community to be aware of any event that will be happening in the community.

## Final App Idea:
## Uniq Event  App:
The majority of the people that are part of the Uniq community sometimes are not aware of the activities that are organized in the unique space students and community members no longer have to miss out on exciting opportunities. The app brings a wide range of events such as academic conferences , workshops, seminors, social gatherings, culturals festivals , career fairs ,Announcement of the presentation of the students' graduation project ,and much more.

# User Stories:
	Must have:
- Upon logging in, I should have access to a dynamic and intuitive event discovery interface.
- User should be able to create an event
- Users can browse through a diverse range of events happening in their community.
- The app should categorize events  based on academic , social,cultural and career -related activities.
- Upon being notify of an events , user should be guided through a seamless registration process
- Users should be able to search for events based on specific keywords, dates or locations.
- The app should provide detailed information about each event, including the event name, date, time, location, description, and any additional requirements or registration processes.
- Users should receive notifications about any changes to event schedules, venue updates, additional speakers, or any other relevant information.
- Users should be able to post an event, update or delete an event.
	
May be
- The app should encourage community members to contribute by organizing and hosting their own events.
- The app should provide the option to customize notification settings according to my preferences.
Would be nice to have
- should be able to explore events by category, date, location, and popularity to find the most suitable and interesting options.
